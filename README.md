### Technologies Used
* LSTM Models for Analysis
* Python code
* TensorFlow

### Functionality
The data is prepared by pulling in BTC historical prices, performing a train/test split to build the LSTM model as a timeseries model, and then analysing the given prices with the predicted prices of the model.
